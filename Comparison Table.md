| Aspect                                      | Existing patents (trusted device + multi‑level auth)                                                                                                                                      | OAuth step‑up & claims (RFC 9470 etc.)                                                                                                                                      | Certificate‑bound tokens                                                                                                        | **Your proposed system**                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Core idea                                   | User plus device factors used to authenticate and then assign different privilege levels or trusted status. Trusted device-specific authentication+2                                      | Client gets a token with certain `acr`/auth strength; when API needs stronger auth, it triggers a step‑up flow to get a new token. scottbrady+2                             | Access tokens are cryptographically bound to a client certificate/key so they cannot be replayed from another device. raidiam+3 | Device‑bound secret phrase login gives restricted, view‑only JWT; password (optionally with device) gives admin JWT for credential changes; tokens are device‑bound and privilege‑encoded.                                                             |
| Device binding                              | Device ID or certificate used as a second factor; trust state may depend on having a known device. Trusted device-specific authentication+2                                               | Not mandatory; device awareness typically via separate policies or `acr` values (e.g., “strong auth” includes device). scottbrady+1                                         | Explicit: token includes confirmation (`cnf`) claim with cert/key thumbprint; server checks token + client cert. raidiam+3      | Device has a public key registered per user; server stores pubkey and derives thumbprint; all tokens for Level 1/2 can carry device thumbprint, and server verifies binding on each request.                                                           |
| User factor type                            | Generally username/password or other secrets, sometimes biometrics; device factor is in addition. Trusted device-specific authentication+2                                                | Typically password + MFA, or passkeys via OIDC; not focused on “secret phrase + device only view mode.” scottbrady+2                                                        | Agnostic to user factor; focuses on token–client binding. raidiam+2                                                             | Two distinct modes: (1) secret phrase + device signature (no password) for Level 1; (2) password (optionally + device) for Level 2. Secret phrase is intentionally not enough for admin actions.                                                       |
| Multi‑level / tiered access                 | Yes, multi‑level authentication: different combinations of user and device credentials yield different access rights. Multi-level authentication+1                                        | Yes: tokens with different auth strength (`acr`) or scopes; APIs require higher level for sensitive operations and trigger step‑up. scottbrady+2                            | Not about levels; focuses on sender constraints. raidiam+2                                                                      | Two explicit levels: Level 1 = VIEW_ONLY (phrase+device), Level 2 = ADMIN (password). Level 1 tokens are designed to never call credential‑modification APIs.                                                                                          |
| How privilege is represented                | In some cases, as roles or access level associated with user/device in server logic; not necessarily a signed token with detailed claims. Trusted device-specific authentication+2        | In token claims like `scope`, `roles`, `acr`, and `amr`; APIs enforce required claim values. cerberauth+3                                                                   | Token has `cnf` claim for binding; privilege still via scopes/roles. raidiam+3                                                  | JWT explicitly carries `auth_level` = VIEW_ONLY or ADMIN plus device thumbprint; backend enforces access purely from these signed claims (e.g., `/view/**` vs `/admin/**`).                                                                            |
| Step‑up behaviour                           | Higher level access may be granted when both user and device credentials succeed; can be multi‑stage, but descriptions are typically high level. Trusted device-specific authentication+2 | Designed around step‑up: resource server sends challenge indicating required higher auth; client re‑authenticates and gets stronger token. scottbrady+2                     | No step‑up semantics; just binding. raidiam+2                                                                                   | You can support step‑up, but with stricter rule: **VIEW_ONLY tokens cannot be upgraded**; admin must always come from a fresh Level 2 login, preventing “token upgrade” flows from phrase‑only sessions.                                               |
| Challenge content                           | Usually nonce/timestamp and maybe device info; not explicitly encoding “requested privilege level” into the challenge that the device signs. Trusted device-specific authentication+2     | Challenge may reference required `acr` or scope but not standardised as “privilege level in signed challenge.” scottbrady+2                                                 | mTLS handshake binds token to cert; challenge is TLS‑level, not privilege‑aware. raidiam+2                                      | Challenge includes `requested_auth_level` (VIEW_ONLY or ADMIN) plus nonce/timestamp; device signs this entire blob, and server ensures issued token’s `auth_level` matches what was signed → replaying a VIEW_ONLY signature cannot yield ADMIN token. |
| Token upgrade / elevation model             | Multi‑level auth may allow session/role elevation when more factors are presented; specifics vary. Multi-level authentication+1                                                           | Designed to upgrade: initial token → step‑up challenge → new, stronger token; earlier token may still exist. scottbrady+2                                                   | No built‑in elevation; used in normal OAuth flows. raidiam+2                                                                    | Non‑elevatable design: VIEW_ONLY tokens are never accepted for any credential‑change flow or exchange; there is **no token upgrade API**. Any privileged operation requires a distinct Level 2 auth run and fresh ADMIN token.                         |
| Focus on credential‑modification protection | Often mentions stronger auth for sensitive operations, but not always formalised as “no credential changes possible under certain tokens.” Trusted device-specific authentication+2       | Common practice is stronger auth for profile/credential endpoints, but pattern is generic (policy, not a protocol that forbids elevation from certain tokens). scottbrady+1 | Not specific to credential changes. raidiam+1                                                                                   | Main goal: **protect credential changes and device registration** behind Level 2 only; protocol guarantees that phrase+device (Level 1) can never be used, directly or indirectly, to alter credentials or registered devices.                         |
| Passwordless aspect                         | Typically centered on passwords + device; some patents discuss non‑password credentials but not in “view‑only mode” framing. Trusted device-specific authentication+2                     | Supports passwordless via WebAuthn/OIDC, but not focused on “passwordless only gives limited view mode by design.” scottbrady+2                                             | Independent of password vs passwordless. raidiam+2                                                                              | Explicit **passwordless restricted mode**: secret phrase + device → view‑only access; full admin is password‑gated.                                                                                                                                    |
| Protocol explicitness (for a patent)        | Protocol is described but often at higher abstraction; core idea is multi‑factor → trust level. Trusted device-specific authentication+2                                                  | Well‑specified messages for step‑up challenge and response; strong prior art for “step‑up auth.” datatracker.ietf+2                                                         | RFCs describe exact token structure and binding; strong prior art for device‑bound tokens. raidiam+2                            | You can define a concrete, custom protocol: messages, challenge format including privilege, JWT claim model, and rules for what each token type can/cannot do, with a special focus on preventing credential‑change escalation from passwordless mode. |
