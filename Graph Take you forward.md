Directed graph 
Undirected graph
# Cycle 
Starts from the node and reach to same node
![[Pasted image 20260211205333.png]]
A node cannot appear twice in a path
Adjacent node should have an edges
Degree of graph - no of edges attached to the graph in UD graph
Degree of graph = 2* E(UD)
Directed Graph- Indegree outdegree
representation of Graph 
m represents edges and n represent nodes
Two ways to store a graph 
1. matrix way -n*m;
   ```
   int [n][m];
   ```
2. list way - 2*n(edges)

```java

```
