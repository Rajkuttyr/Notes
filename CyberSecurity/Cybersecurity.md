# Network
1.  It is defined as medium which is responsible of transmitting a data fro one node to another
2. Network Types-Internet intranet and pan

# Topology
Toplogy - how internet are connected
## Mesh Topology
Every node is connected to each other.
Disadvantage: Expensive
# Star topology
- Nodes connected to centralised device like switches hub or router;
	Disadvantage - If central node Damaged every thing is damaged
# Bus Toplogy 
- BackBone cable running and all nodes are connected to it
CSMA CSMA/CD(collision detection)
# Ring Topology
- All nodes are circulary connected 
# Hybrid Topology 
- Combination of two or more topology

# OSI reference model
 - OSi stands open system interconnection
 - it is beveloped by iso
 - it is a 7 layer architectur
 1. Application layer - Data Generation
 2. Presentation layer -  Perform transulationn compression and encryption
 3. Sesssion layer-Managing session
 4. Transport Layer-End to end data transmission -TCP/IP
 5. Network Layer-Ip adress - routing that data
 6. DataLink layer-error free transmisssion
 7. Physical layer-Medium of transfer
