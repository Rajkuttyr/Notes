# Page 1: Earthing

## Definition of Earthing

Earthing is the process of connecting the metal parts of electrical equipment to the ground (earth) using a conductor.

Purpose:  
• Prevent electric shock  
• Protect equipment  
• Provide safe path for fault current

---

## Why Earthing is Necessary

If insulation fails, current flows through metal body. Earthing sends this current safely to ground.

Without earthing → Electric shock  
With earthing → Current goes to earth safely

---

# 1. Magnitude of Current (Most Important)

Current is the amount of electricity flowing through the body.

Unit: Ampere (A)

Higher current → More dangerous

Effects of current:

|Current|Effect|
|---|---|
|1 mA|Slight sensation|
|10 mA|Painful shock|
|30 mA|Muscle control loss|
|100 mA|Fatal (death possible)|

Conclusion:

Higher current increases shock severity.

---

# 2. Voltage

Voltage is the force that pushes current through the body.

Unit: Volt (V)

Higher voltage → Higher current → More danger

Examples:

• 12 V → Low danger  
• 230 V → Dangerous  
• 440 V → Very dangerous

Conclusion:

High voltage causes severe shock.

---

# 3. Body Resistance

Unit: Ohm (Ω)

Dry skin → High resistance → Less danger  
Wet skin → Low resistance → More danger

Examples:

• Dry skin: 100,000 Ω  
• Wet skin: 1,000 Ω

Conclusion:

Lower resistance increases shock risk.

---

# 4. Duration of Contact (Time)

Time is how long current flows through the body.

Longer time → More dangerous

Examples:

• Short contact → Minor injury  
• Long contact → Severe injury or death

Conclusion:

Shock severity increases with time.

---

# 5. Path of Current Through Body

Path means route of current flow in body.

Dangerous paths:

• Hand to hand  
• Hand to leg  
• Hand to chest

Most dangerous path:

Through heart → Causes heart failure

Diagram:

```id="dgjao6"
Hand → Heart → Leg
(Most dangerous path)
```

Conclusion:

Current passing through heart is very dangerous.

---

# 6. Frequency of Current

Frequency is number of cycles per second.

Unit: Hertz (Hz)

AC current (50 Hz) is more dangerous than DC current.

Reason:

AC affects heart rhythm.

Example:

Domestic supply: 50 Hz → Dangerous

Conclusion:

Higher frequency increases shock risk.

---

# Summary Table

|Parameter|Effect|
|---|---|
|Current|Most important factor|
|Voltage|Increases current|
|Resistance|Lower resistance increases risk|
|Time|Longer time increases danger|
|Path|Heart path most dangerous|
|Frequency|AC more dangerous|

---

# Conclusion

Electrical shock hazard depends on parameters such as current, voltage, resistance, duration, current path, and frequency. Higher current, higher voltage, longer contact time, and current passing through heart increase danger. Proper safety measures like earthing, insulation, and protective equipment help prevent electrical shock.
