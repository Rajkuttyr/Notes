# Earthing, Earthing Resistance and Reading Earth Tester (20 Marks Answer)

---

# Introduction

Electricity is widely used in homes, industries, and power systems. However, improper handling of electrical systems can cause electric shock, fire, and equipment damage. Earthing is one of the most important safety methods used in electrical systems to protect humans and equipment from electrical hazards.

Earthing provides a safe path for fault current to flow into the ground, thereby preventing electric shock and ensuring safe operation of electrical systems.

# Definition of Earthing

Earthing is the process of connecting the metal parts of electrical equipment to the earth using a low resistance conductor.

In simple words, earthing connects electrical equipment to the ground to prevent electric shock.

---

# Objectives of Earthing

The main objectives of earthing are:

• To protect human beings from electric shock  
• To provide safe path for fault current  
• To protect electrical equipment  
• To prevent fire accidents  
• To maintain voltage stability

---

# Working Principle of Earthing

Under normal conditions, electric current flows through the circuit.

But when insulation fails, fault current flows through metal body.

Earthing provides a low resistance path to ground.

As a result:

• Current flows safely into ground  
• Prevents electric shock  
• Protects equipment

---

# Types of Earthing

There are three main types of earthing:

---

## 1. Plate Earthing

In this method, a metal plate is buried in the ground.

Materials used:

• Copper plate  
• GI (Galvanized Iron) plate

Depth: 3 meters below ground

Advantages:

• Good conductivity  
• Reliable

---

## 2. Pipe Earthing (Most Common)

In this method, a GI pipe is buried vertically in ground.

Advantages:

• Low cost  
• Easy installation  
• Most efficient

Used in:

• Houses  
• Industries

---

## 3. Rod Earthing

In this method, a copper or steel rod is driven into ground.

Advantages:

• Simple method  
• Used in small installations

---

# Definition of Earthing Resistance

Earthing resistance is the resistance offered by earth electrode to the flow of electric current into ground.

Unit: Ohm (Ω)

Symbol: R

Formula:

R = V / I

Where:

R = Resistance  
V = Voltage  
I = Current

---

# Importance of Low Earthing Resistance

Low earthing resistance is very important for safety.

If resistance is low:

• Current flows easily  
• System is safe

If resistance is high:

• Current cannot flow easily  
• Electric shock risk increases

---

# Standard Values of Earthing Resistance

Recommended values:

• Domestic wiring → less than 5 Ω  
• Industrial systems → less than 1 Ω  
• Power stations → less than 0.5 Ω

Lower resistance means better earthing.

---

# Factors Affecting Earthing Resistance

Earthing resistance depends on several factors:

---

## 1. Soil Type

Wet soil → Low resistance  
Dry soil → High resistance

---

## 2. Soil Moisture

More moisture → Better earthing

---

## 3. Depth of Electrode

More depth → Lower resistance

---

## 4. Soil Temperature

High temperature → High resistance

---

# Earth Tester (Earth Megger)

Earth tester is an instrument used to measure earthing resistance.

Purpose:

• Measure earth resistance  
• Check earthing quality  
• Ensure electrical safety

---

# Parts of Earth Tester

Main parts include:

• Earth electrode terminal (E)  
• Current terminal (C)  
• Potential terminal (P)  
• Display meter

---

# Working of Earth Tester

Earth tester works on voltage and current measurement principle.

It measures resistance using formula:

R = V / I

---

# Procedure to Measure Earthing Resistance

Step 1: Connect earth tester to earth electrode

Step 2: Insert auxiliary electrodes in soil

Step 3: Connect wires properly

Step 4: Switch ON tester

Step 5: Read resistance value

---

# Interpretation of Earth Tester Reading

If resistance is:

• 0 – 2 Ω → Excellent earthing  
• 2 – 5 Ω → Good earthing  
• Above 5 Ω → Poor earthing

Poor earthing must be corrected.

---

# Advantages of Earthing

• Prevents electric shock  
• Protects equipment  
• Prevents fire accidents  
• Ensures safety  
• Improves system reliability

---

# Applications of Earthing

Used in:

• Houses  
• Industries  
• Power stations  
• Electrical installations

---

# Maintenance of Earthing System

Proper maintenance is required:

• Regular inspection  
• Check resistance  
• Maintain soil moisture

---

# Conclusion

Earthing is an essential safety system used in electrical installations to protect human life and equipment. It provides a safe path for fault current to flow into ground. Earthing resistance must be low for effective protection. Earth tester is used to measure earthing resistance and ensure proper functioning of earthing system. Proper earthing prevents electric shock, protects equipment, and ensures safe electrical operation.
