## 1. How is a data warehouse different from a database? Identify the similarity.

**Difference:**

- A database is used for daily transaction processing (OLTP), while a data warehouse is used for analysis and decision making (OLAP).
    
- Database stores current data, whereas data warehouse stores historical data.
    

**Similarity:**

Both store structured data in tables and use DBMS for data management.

## 5. How does data mart differ from metadata?

**Data Mart:**  
It is a subset of data warehouse used for specific department analysis.

**Metadata:**
