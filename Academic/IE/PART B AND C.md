# Introduction

Plant location refers to the selection of the best geographical site for establishing a factory. Proper plant location is very important because it affects production cost, transportation cost, availability of raw materials, labor, profit, and overall efficiency.

A sugar factory converts sugarcane into sugar through processes like crushing, juice extraction, purification, evaporation, crystallization, and packaging.

Sugarcane is:

- Bulky
    
- Heavy
    
- Perishable (loses sugar content quickly after harvesting)
    

Therefore, sugar factories must be located near sugarcane growing areas.

---

# Basic Diagram of Sugar Production System

```
Sugarcane Farm → Transport → Sugar Factory → Storage → Market
```

---

# Need for Proper Plant Location

Proper plant location helps to:

• Reduce transportation cost

# Introduction

Plant layout refers to the physical arrangement of machines, departments, workstations, storage areas, and material handling equipment inside a factory. A good plant layout ensures smooth flow of materials, reduces material handling cost, improves productivity, and utilizes space efficiently.

Quantitative approaches use mathematical models, formulas, and numerical techniques to design the best plant layout. These methods help engineers select the most efficient arrangement scientifically rather than using guesswork.

---

# Objectives of Quantitative Plant Layout

The main objectives are:

1. To minimize material handling cost
    
2. To reduce distance travelled by materials
    
3. To improve workflow efficiency
    
4. To reduce production time
    
5. To utilize available space effectively
    
6. To improve productivity
    
7. To reduce congestion and delays
    

---

# Basic Plant Layout Diagram

```
Raw Material → Cutting → Assembly → Testing → Packaging → Storage
```

In quantitative approach, we calculate the best arrangement mathematically.

---

# Important Quantitative Techniques in Plant Layout

The major quantitative techniques are:

1. Load Distance Method
    
2. Centre of Gravity Method
    
3. CRAFT Method
    
4. Linear Programming Method
    
5. Graph Theory Method
    
6. From-To Chart Method
    
7. Quadratic Assignment Method
    

---

# 1. Load Distance Method

This is one of the most important quantitative techniques.

It calculates total material handling cost based on load and distance.

Formula:

Load Distance = Load × Distance

Where:

Load = Number of units moved  
Distance = Distance between departments

---

## Example:

Suppose:

Department A → Department B

Load = 50 units  
Distance = 10 meters

Load Distance = 50 × 10 = 500

If another layout has distance = 5 meters

Load Distance = 50 × 5 = 250

Second layout is better because cost is lower.

---

## Diagram Example

```
Layout 1:

A ----------- B
Distance = 10 m

Layout 2:

A ----- B
Distance = 5 m
```

Layout 2 is better.

---

## Advantages:

• Easy to calculate  
• Reduces material handling cost  
• Improves efficiency

---

# 2. Centre of Gravity Method

This method is used to find best location of a facility based on coordinates.

It finds central location that minimizes transportation cost.

Formula:

[  
X = \frac{\sum WiXi}{\sum Wi}  
]

[  
Y = \frac{\sum WiYi}{\sum Wi}  
]

Where:

Wi = weight or load  
Xi, Yi = coordinates

---

## Example:

|Location|X|Y|Load|
|---|---|---|---|
|A|2|3|10|
|B|6|7|20|

Calculation:

X = (10×2 + 20×6) / (10+20)  
X = (20 + 120)/30 = 4.67

Y = (10×3 + 20×7)/30  
Y = (30 + 140)/30 = 5.67

Best location = (4.67, 5.67)

---

## Diagram

```
        B(6,7)
          ●
          
          
    ●
 A(2,3)

Centre of Gravity = Middle point
```

---

## Advantages:

• Minimizes transportation cost  
• Provides best location mathematically

# 3. CRAFT Method (Computerized Relative Allocation of Facilities Technique)

CRAFT is a computer-based improvement technique.

It improves existing layout by swapping departments.

---

## Steps:

Step 1: Start with existing layout

Example:

```
A   B
C   D
```

Step 2: Calculate cost

Step 3: Swap departments

```
B   A
C   D
```

Step 4: Calculate new cost

Step 5: Select layout with minimum cost

---

## Advantages:

• Improves layout efficiently  
• Reduces cost  
• Computer-based method

---

# 4. Linear Programming Method

Linear programming is used to minimize cost and optimize layout.

It is used when multiple alternatives exist.

---

## Objective Function:

Minimize:

Z = C1X1 + C2X2 + C3X3

Where:

C = cost  
X = distance or load

---

## Example:

Minimize transport cost between departments.

---

## Advantages:

• Provides optimal solution  
• Reduces cost

---

# 5. Graph Theory Method

Graph theory represents departments as nodes and connections as edges.

Example Diagram:

```
   A ------- B
   |         |
   |         |
   C ------- D
```

Shortest distance between departments is selected.

---

## Advantages:

• Easy visualization  
• Reduces distance

---

# 6. From-To Chart Method

This chart shows movement of materials between departments.

Example:

|From|To|Load|
|---|---|---|
|A|B|50|
|B|C|40|
|C|D|30|

Diagram:

```
A → B → C → D
```

Departments with high load should be placed close together.

---

# 7. Quadratic Assignment Method

This is advanced mathematical technique.

It assigns departments to locations to minimize cost.

Objective:

Minimize:

Flow × Distance

---

# Example Plant Layout Optimization

Initial Layout:

```
A -------- B -------- C
```

Improved Layout:

```
A ---- B ---- C
```

Distance reduced.

---

# Cost Comparison Graph (Example)

```
Cost
 |
 |        *
 |      *
 |    *
 |  *
 |____________________
        Distance
```

Cost increases with distance.
