| Core idea                                   | User plus device factors used to authenticate and then assign different privilege levels or trusted status. [US7979899B2][p-us7979899] [US8336091B2][p-us8336091]                                  | Client gets a token with certain auth strength (`acr`); when an API needs stronger auth, it triggers a step-up flow to get a new token. [RFC 9470][r-rfc9470] [Scott Brady – Step-up Auth][a-scott-stepup]                   | Access tokens are cryptographically bound to a client certificate/key so they cannot be replayed from another device. [Raidiam – Cert-bound tokens][a-raidiam] [IBM Verify – Cert-bound tokens][a-ibm-cert] [Curity – mTLS tokens][a-curity-mtls] | Device-bound secret phrase login gives restricted, view-only JWT; password (optionally with device) gives admin JWT for credential changes; tokens are device-bound and privilege-encoded.                                                             |
| Device binding                              | Device ID or certificate used as a second factor; trust state may depend on having a known device. [US7979899B2][p-us7979899] [US8336091B2][p-us8336091]                                           | Not mandatory; device awareness typically via separate policies or higher `acr` (e.g., “strong auth” includes device). [RFC 9470][r-rfc9470]                                                                                 | Explicit: token includes confirmation (`cnf`) claim with cert/key thumbprint; server checks token + client cert. [Raidiam – Cert-bound tokens][a-raidiam] [RFC 8705][r-rfc8705] [IBM Verify – Cert-bound tokens][a-ibm-cert]                      | Device has a public key registered per user; server stores pubkey and derives thumbprint; all tokens for Level 1/2 can carry device thumbprint, and server verifies binding on each request.                                                           |
| User factor type                            | Generally username/password or other secrets, sometimes biometrics; device factor is in addition. [US7979899B2][p-us7979899] [US8336091B2][p-us8336091]                                            | Typically password + MFA, or passkeys via OIDC; not focused on “secret phrase + device only view mode.” [Scott Brady – Step-up Auth][a-scott-stepup] [RFC 9470][r-rfc9470]                                                   | Agnostic to user factor; focuses on token–client binding. [Raidiam – Cert-bound tokens][a-raidiam] [RFC 8705][r-rfc8705]                                                                                                                          | Two distinct modes: (1) secret phrase + device signature (no password) for Level 1; (2) password (optionally + device) for Level 2. Secret phrase is intentionally not enough for admin actions.                                                       |
| Multi-level / tiered access                 | Yes, multi-level authentication: different combinations of user and device credentials yield different access rights. [US8336091B2][p-us8336091] [US20110055913A1][p-us20110055913]                | Yes: tokens with different auth strength (`acr`) or scopes; APIs require higher level for sensitive operations and trigger step-up. [RFC 9470][r-rfc9470] [Authlete – Step-up Auth][a-authlete-stepup]                       | Not about levels; focuses on sender constraints. [Raidiam – Cert-bound tokens][a-raidiam]                                                                                                                                                         | Two explicit levels: Level 1 = VIEW_ONLY (phrase+device), Level 2 = ADMIN (password). Level 1 tokens are designed to never call credential-modification APIs.                                                                                          |
| How privilege is represented                | Often as roles/access level associated with user/device in server logic; not always via a signed token with detailed claims. [US7979899B2][p-us7979899] [US8336091B2][p-us8336091]                 | In token claims like `scope`, `roles`, `acr`, and `amr`; APIs enforce required claim values. [CerberAuth – Token Claims][a-cerber-claims] [Auth0 – Least Privilege Tokens][a-auth0-least-priv]                               | Token has `cnf` claim for binding; privilege still via scopes/roles. [Raidiam – Cert-bound tokens][a-raidiam] [RFC 8705][r-rfc8705]                                                                                                               | JWT explicitly carries `auth_level` = VIEW_ONLY or ADMIN plus device thumbprint; backend enforces access purely from these signed claims (e.g., `/view/**` vs `/admin/**`).                                                                            |
| Step-up behaviour                           | Higher-level access may be granted when both user and device credentials succeed; specifics vary by implementation. [US8336091B2][p-us8336091] [US20110055913A1][p-us20110055913]                  | Designed to upgrade: initial token → step-up challenge → new, stronger token; earlier token may still exist. [RFC 9470][r-rfc9470] [Scott Brady – Step-up Auth][a-scott-stepup] [Authlete – Step-up Auth][a-authlete-stepup] | No explicit step-up semantics; used in normal OAuth flows. [RFC 8705][r-rfc8705]                                                                                                                                                                  | You can support step-up, but with stricter rule: VIEW_ONLY tokens cannot be upgraded; admin must always come from a fresh Level 2 login, preventing “token upgrade” flows from phrase-only sessions.                                                   |
| Challenge content                           | Usually nonce/timestamp and maybe device info; not explicitly encoding “requested privilege level” into the challenge that the device signs. [US7979899B2][p-us7979899] [US8336091B2][p-us8336091] | Challenge may reference required `acr` or scope conceptually but not standardized as “privilege level in signed challenge.” [RFC 9470][r-rfc9470]                                                                            | mTLS handshake binds token to cert; challenge is TLS-level, not privilege-aware. [RFC 8705][r-rfc8705]                                                                                                                                            | Challenge includes `requested_auth_level` (VIEW_ONLY or ADMIN) plus nonce/timestamp; device signs this entire blob, and server ensures issued token’s `auth_level` matches what was signed → replaying a VIEW_ONLY signature cannot yield ADMIN token. |
| Token upgrade / elevation model             | Multi-level auth may allow session/role elevation when more factors are presented; details vary. [US8336091B2][p-us8336091] [US20110055913A1][p-us20110055913]                                     | Designed to upgrade: step-up protocol issues a new token with higher auth strength; older token might still be usable for low-risk calls. [RFC 9470][r-rfc9470] [Scott Brady – Step-up Auth][a-scott-stepup]                 | No built-in elevation; just binding. [RFC 8705][r-rfc8705]                                                                                                                                                                                        | Non-elevatable design: VIEW_ONLY tokens are never accepted for any credential-change flow or exchange; there is no token upgrade API. Any privileged operation requires a distinct Level 2 auth run and fresh ADMIN token.                             |
| Focus on credential-modification protection | Often mentions stronger auth for sensitive operations, but not formalised as “no credential changes possible under certain tokens.” [US7979899B2][p-us7979899] [US8336091B2][p-us8336091]          | Common pattern is stronger auth for profile/credential endpoints, but usually as policy, not a protocol that forbids elevation from specific token types. [RFC 9470][r-rfc9470] [Scott Brady – Step-up Auth][a-scott-stepup] | Not specific to credential changes; goal is preventing token theft/replay across clients. [RFC 8705][r-rfc8705] [Raidiam – Cert-bound tokens][a-raidiam]                                                                                          | Main goal: protect credential changes and device registration behind Level 2 only; protocol guarantees that phrase+device (Level 1) can never be used, directly or indirectly, to alter credentials or registered devices.                             |
| Passwordless aspect                         | Typically centered on passwords + device; some patents discuss non-password credentials but not as “view-only mode.” [US7979899B2][p-us7979899] [US8336091B2][p-us8336091]                         | Supports passwordless via WebAuthn/OIDC, but not focused on “passwordless only gives limited view mode by design.” [Scott Brady – Step-up Auth][a-scott-stepup]                                                              | Independent of password vs passwordless; just binds tokens to client. [RFC 8705][r-rfc8705]                                                                                                                                                       | Explicit passwordless restricted mode: secret phrase + device → view-only access; full admin is password-gated.                                                                                                                                        |
| Protocol explicitness (for a patent)        | Protocol described but often at higher abstraction; core idea is multi-factor → trust level. [US7979899B2][p-us7979899] [US8336091B2][p-us8336091]                                                 | Well-specified messages for step-up challenge and response; strong prior art for “step-up auth.” [RFC 9470][r-rfc9470] [Authlete – Step-up Auth][a-authlete-stepup]                                                          | RFCs describe exact token structure and binding; strong prior art for device-bound tokens.
