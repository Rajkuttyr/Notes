# 21. Software Life Cycle (SDLC)

## Definition (3 marks)

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a systematic process used for developing high-quality software. It defines a series of well-defined phases that guide developers from requirement collection to maintenance.

The main objectives of SDLC are:

- To develop software systematically
    
- To improve software quality
    
- To complete the project within time and budget
    
- To reduce development risk
    

Each phase produces deliverables used in the next phase.

---

## Software Life Cycle Models (List) (2 marks)

The major SDLC models are:

1. Waterfall Model
    
2. Iterative Model
    
3. Incremental Model
    
4. Spiral Model
    
5. V-Model
    
6. Agile Model
    
7. Prototyping Model
    
8. RAD Model (Rapid Application Development)
    

---

## Waterfall Model Explanation (5 marks)

The Waterfall Model is a linear and sequential software development model. In this model, development flows downward like a waterfall through different phases.

Each phase must be completed before moving to the next phase.

### Phases:

### 1. Requirement Analysis

In this phase, all user requirements are collected and documented in the Software Requirement Specification (SRS).

Output: SRS document

---

### 2. System Design

In this phase, system architecture and design are created based on requirements.

Output: Design document

---

### 3. Implementation (Coding)

Developers write code based on design specifications.

Output: Source code

---

### 4. Testing

Testing is done to identify and fix errors.

Types:

- Unit testing
    
- Integration testing
    
- System testing
    

---

### 5. Deployment

Software is installed and delivered to users.

---

### 6. Maintenance

After deployment, software is maintained to fix bugs and improve performance.

Types:

- Corrective maintenance
    
- Adaptive maintenance
    

---

## Advantages

- Easy to understand
    
- Easy to manage
    
- Proper documentation
    
- Suitable for small projects
    

---

## Disadvantages

- Cannot handle changing requirements
    
- Testing happens late
    
- High risk in complex projects
